# Git Commit Message Plus

A git commit message highlighter that should be nicer than the built-in one.

## Features

  <https://github.com/PanAeon/vscode-tmgrammar-test>
* TODO: Proper `git commit -v` diff highlighting even when running `git` in
  not-English.
* TODO: Mark commit message subject line in bold, it *is* a heading after all.
* TODO: Mark too long subject lines as errors with hover help and stuff.
* TODO: Mark trailing punctuation as an error with hover help and stuff.
